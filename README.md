    + If Naomi appears in a chapter select menu, includes her banner, but requires her assets be present. (Of course, if you have Naomi working, then you already have this mod.)

## Content:

This mod adds a few aesthetic tweaks to the game:

### Always-on:
+ Banner menus for each character, replacing the character selection menus in Chapters 1-4.
+ Larger, interactive character buttons in Chapter 5.

### Optional:
+ Recoloring the trims of character textboxes to match their name colors.
+ Recoloring of the trims of the player's textbox and menu choice textbox to match the player color.

Options can be toggled in the mod's Magmalink Mod Settings menu.
